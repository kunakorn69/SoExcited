			In a world where most advertising and marketing agencies are focused on maximizing their own profits, as quickly as possible, we take a different approach.  Our business philosophy is that our clients' business growth is the main priority, not our own.  We would rather have a small handful of extremely happy clients, as opposed to thousands of clients who are indifferent about our services.
			<br /><br />Prior to recommending any campaign to our clients and prospective clients, a great deal of planning goes into each program.  You can be certain, when we make a particular recommendation, that there is an extremely good reason for the strategy and campaign we're suggesting.
			<br /><br />As opposed to large advertising agencies that typically only work with multi-million dollar clients, our focus is on small-to-medium sized businesses and business professionals.  In light of the fact that our typical client usually has a much smaller budget, as compared to large corporations, with multi-million dollar advertising budgets, we recognize that every dollar must be used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
			<br /><br />If you decide to work with us, you will not be a number on a piece of paper or a spreadsheet.  We deeply value the fact that, behind each business we work with, there are real people, with real responsibilities, and often real families that depend on the success of the businesses with whom we work.  We approach each new program with a deep sense of responsibility, to deliver results that will exceed your expectations.
