        	We are required by the FTC to inform you that there is a financial relationship between our company and some of the products or services we recommend or promote.
			<br /><br />I. Material Affiliation
			<br />Please assume that, any time a product or service is mentioned, that we may be compensated. Any recommendations made by us, for any product or service, have been made in good faith, based on either our own use of the product, or based on the merit of the product in public opinion.
			<br /><br />II. Partiality Statement
			<br />Because we may be paid, a bias for those products may exist. Every effort has been made to ensure that all reviews are accurate and true, but some bias can be assumed simply because of the material relationship between our company and the third party companies involved.
			<br /><br />III. Compensation
			<br />We may receive monetary compensation for the links in this document, on our website, and/or the links shared in emails sent to our opt-in subscribers. If you purchase a product that we recommend, please be advised that we may be paid a commission.

				This disclosure has been made to let you know that any product or service recommendation that we make should be assumed to have some financial benefit for our company. While this may not always be true, it should be assumed that it is.
